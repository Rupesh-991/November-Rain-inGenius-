Plug in to Remove Duplicate Files from Smart Mobile Devices: Images
The continuous development of the information technology and mobile communication world and the potentials available in the smart devices make these devices widely used in daily life. The mobile applications with the internet are distinguished simple, essay to use in any time/anywhere, communication between relatives and friends in different places in the world. The social application networks make these devices received several of the duplicate files daily which lead to many drawbacks such inefficient use of storage, low performance of CPU, RAM, and increasing consumption battery. In this paper, we present a good scheme to remove from the duplicate files, and we focus on image files as a common case in social apps. Our work overcomes on the above-mentioned issues and focuses to use hash function and Huffman code to build unique code for each image.
This program converts the given string into huffman code.this is done by first counting the frequency of the letters and then creating a minheap which is  then converted into huffman code.in the main program this is used to obtain code 2.the md5 code is converted to huffman code to obtain code 2.this helps in saving data as huffman code occupies less space.
